keedger8r: An edger8r for Keystone Enclave
==========================================

`keedger8r` is a glue code generator which is a modified version of [Open Enclave](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave)'s `oeedger8r` tool which is a plugin to Intel SGX's Edger8r in turn. It was a temporal tool at AIST.

Now Keystone has [keyedge](https://github.com/keystone-enclave/keyedge) which is implemented from scratch. I'd like to push 
keedger8r here as a record.

The original licenses for the files from Edger8r and oeedger8r are keeped.
